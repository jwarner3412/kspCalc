  <p>
    Being accurate with your orbit time period is far more important than matching altitude exactly.
    Make sure to compensate for decouplers and adjust your period back after each satelitte stage event.
    Satellites should be within 0.05sec of desired orbit, use 'Ctrl' + translation thrusters. <br> 
    *Note: Placement precision near 0 will require a 0' inclination.
