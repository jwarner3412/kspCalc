# KSP Satellite Depolyment Calculator
## v0.9.0 can be used at https://jwarner3412.github.io/kerbility
Datafile has not been updated.

dev branch for v0.9.0 (current with master)
dev2 branch is for the EM6 re-write, hopefully less clunky

User inputs which sol system (stock or realism overhaul), and which orbital body in which they wish to deploy thier satellite network, along with target orbit parameters, and the amount of satellites contained in launch vehicle.

Calculator outputs deployment orbit parameters and dV required to circularize to target orbit allowing satellites to be spaced evenly around the planet.
